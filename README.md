## Easily add modules
- In the Main Modules section of TireFire.py add a function. Example "ftp()"
- In ftp() add the variables "tfp_title", "ftp_comment", "ftp_lst", "ftp", and "scan".
- fpt_lst should be a list of the following commands you would like to add (index 0 = scan 1)
- scan will be the variable passed in determining which command to run
- Be sure to add a doit(command) to the bottom of the function.
- Add your function to home_lst (line 32).

## How to build
- git clone https://github.com/CoolHandSquid/TireFire.git
- cd TireFire
- sudo ./Build.sh 
## Useage
* TireFire **NEEDS** to be run in terminater. 
* Termianator does not allow root to run the --new-tab function programatically, therefore TireFire may only function from a non-root context.
* Once Build.sh has been run TireFire will have been added to your path. 
* Type "TireFire" and you will be yeeting with a cyber **cannon!**
